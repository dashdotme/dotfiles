# My Dotfiles
Odd naming comes from [Chezmoi](chezmoi.io), which I use to manage my files across machines quickly and safely.

Repo includes files not used on all machines (eg. tiling managers for both hyprland (linux) and aerospace (macos) configurations).

The result looks like this:

In practice, I fullscreen the windows with a bind.
